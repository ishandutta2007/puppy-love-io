This is the repo for the demo at I/O 2016.  To keep the repo in sync with the demo, not accepting issues or PRs.

The demo is best viewed on an iOS Simulator or using a mobile emulated mode on a browser.  To make it look great on desktop as well, simply add a width to the `md-card` element and a flex container around the cards with `row wrap` style.
